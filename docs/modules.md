1. Farm Setup Basics  
- Essential foundation for your aquaculture operation  
- Secure proof of legal rights or ownership of the farm area (e.g., license to operate, LGU business permit).  
- Obtain an Environmental Compliance Certificate (ECC) or Certificate of Non-Coverage (CNC) from the DENR-EMB.  
- Create a detailed farm map showing the layout of ponds, water sources, discharge points, and all facilities.  
- Design the farm to include a reservoir pond for incoming water and a separate settling pond for farm effluents.  
- Ensure the farm layout physically segregates aquaculture activities from any livestock production to prevent cross-contamination.  
- Establish a buffer zone around the farm in accordance with existing regulations (e.g., 50-100 meters from the sea, 20-50 meters from river banks).  
- Design and construct separate, safe, and properly ventilated storage facilities for fuel, chemicals, feeds, and veterinary drugs.  
- Construct sanitary facilities (toilets, septic tanks) at least 50 meters away from any pond area or water system to prevent contamination.  
- Ensure the design of culture facilities (ponds/tanks) meets the biological needs of the shrimp or crabs you plan to culture.  
- Develop a risk assessment report identifying potential chemical, biological, and physical hazards from the surrounding environment.  

2. Pond & Water Care  
- Optimal water quality and pond management  
- Completely drain and dry ponds after each harvest until the soil cracks to eliminate unwanted species and pathogens.  
- Perform pond bottom tilling or cultivation to enhance soil quality and release toxic gases.  
- Apply lime as needed based on soil analysis to correct soil acidity and improve water pH.  
- Install and regularly maintain appropriate screens on all water inlet and outlet gates to prevent the entry/escape of organisms.  
- Ensure a standby aeration system (e.g., paddle wheels) is available and functional to maintain suitable dissolved oxygen levels.  
- Regularly monitor key water quality parameters (e.g., dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature, salinity) and keep a detailed log.  
- Filter and treat all incoming water through a reservoir or conditioning pond before it enters the culture ponds.  
- Manage effluents by passing discharged water through a settling pond to reduce suspended solids before release.  
- Use only permitted chemicals (e.g., piscicides, fertilizers) for farm preparation strictly according to the manufacturer's label or competent authority's advice.  
- Maintain all dikes, gates, and pond liners to prevent leakages and ensure structural integrity.  

3. Healthy Stock Sourcing  
- Quality fingerlings and stocking practices  
- Source shrimp post-larvae (PLs) and crab crablets only from BFAR-accredited and registered hatcheries.  
- Require and keep a copy of the Health Certificate for all batches of PLs or crablets to be stocked, confirming they are clinically healthy.  
- Quarantine all new stocks in a designated, separate quarantine facility before introducing them into the main culture system.  
- Ensure that any live or natural feeds used have a health certification from the competent authority.  
- Adhere strictly to the recommended stocking density for your specific species and culture system (e.g., extensive, semi-intensive, intensive).  
- Keep detailed records of the origin of all seeds, including the supplier's name, date of stocking, and quantity.  
- Transport new stocks from the hatchery to the farm under conditions that do not adversely affect their quality or cause stress.  
- Acclimate the PLs or crablets to the pond's water temperature and salinity before releasing them to minimize stress and mortality.  
- Visually inspect stocks upon arrival for any signs of disease, weakness, or abnormalities before stocking.  
- Do not stock shrimp or crabs that are visibly diseased or show signs of pathological changes.  

4. Farm Access Control  
- Biosecurity protocols and visitor management  
- Install and maintain a secure perimeter fence around the entire farm to prevent the entry of stray animals and unauthorized persons.  
- Establish a single, controlled entry and exit point for all personnel and vehicles.  
- Install and regularly maintain functional footbaths at the entrance of the farm and before entering any production area.  
- Install and maintain a functional tire bath or disinfectant spray system at the main vehicle entrance of the farm.  
- Post clear and visible biosecurity warning signs at all entry points.  
- Provide dedicated and properly sanitized farm equipment for each pond or production unit to prevent cross-contamination.  
- Require all workers to wear suitable and clean working clothes and practice proper hygiene before commencing work.  
- Implement a protocol for visitors, which may include restricting access to sensitive areas and requiring them to follow all biosecurity procedures.  
- Install physical barriers like crab fences and bird scaring devices to prevent the entry of pathogen carriers.  
- Maintain a logbook of all personnel and vehicle traffic entering and exiting the farm for traceability.  

5. Disease Readiness  
- Prevention, monitoring, and response protocols  
- Develop and maintain a written Aquatic Animal Health Plan for your farm.  
- Conduct regular health monitoring of your stock to recognize early signs of disease or abnormalities.  
- Establish a designated quarantine area or facility for isolating and treating sick shrimp or crabs.  
- Establish a clear, written protocol for the safe handling and proper disposal (e.g., burying, rendering) of dead or diseased animals.  
- Keep detailed records of any disease occurrences, treatments applied, and mortalities observed.  
- Use veterinary drugs and other chemicals only when necessary, strictly following the manufacturer's instructions or a qualified expert's prescription.  
- Strictly observe and record the withdrawal period for any veterinary drugs used to ensure the final product is safe for consumption.  
- Maintain a list of prohibited chemicals and ensure none are used at any stage of farm preparation or culture.  
- Develop a disease emergency response plan, including who to notify (e.g., BFAR Fish Health Officer) in case of a significant disease event.  
- Ensure all veterinary drugs and medicated feeds are obtained only from registered and authorized suppliers.
