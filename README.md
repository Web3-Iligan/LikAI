# LikAI: The Adaptive Biosecurity Coach

![LikAI Cover](public/cover-photo.png)

LikAI is an AI-driven biosecurity coach designed for small and medium-sized shrimp farmers. It transforms complex GAqP (Good Aquaculture Practices) into personalized, adaptive, and affordable action plans, empowering farmers to build resilient operations and secure profitable harvests.

- **Interactive How-To Guides:** 
   - Visual and checklist-based guides for key farm tasks, with integrated AI chat support.
- **Progress Tracking:** 
   - Dashboard to monitor completion of biosecurity tasks and overall farm health.
- **Compliance & Certification:** 
   - Automated compliance reports for BFAR accreditation and export standards.
- **Offline Access:** 
   - Downloadable PDF reports for field reference.
- **AI-Powered Assessment and Chatbot:**

## High Level Architecture

![High Level Architecture](public\high-level-architecture.png)

This diagram illustrates Likai's robust, hybrid architecture, combining the power of the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) for secure, decentralized backend operations with client-side capabilities for enhanced user experience, including offline access, and external AI integration.

<br>

## How Likai's Features Leverage ICP

- Personalized Biosecurity & GAqP Action Plans: 
   - The plan generation logic and the storage of the farmer's assessment data and the resulting dynamic plan would be in canisters. The plan's evolution is tamper-proof.
- AI Coach & Knowledge Assistant: 
   - The chat interface, chat history, and the logic for contextualizing prompts for external LLMs (via HTTPs outcalls) would be canister-based. The "Practical Biosecurity Library" content itself could be hosted in canisters for immutability.
- Smart Investment Guidance: 
   - The logic for calculating ROI, generating investment recommendations, and storing the farmer's investment plans would run in canisters.
- Compliance & Market Access (Future/Enterprise): 
   - The generation of compliance reports and the storage of certification data would leverage canisters for immutable record-keeping and verifiable outputs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/likai.git
   cd likai
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   - Use the DevContainer to create a container with the preconfigured installation. There should be a prompt in the editor in which you can install a Dev Container and open the project in the Container
   - Wait for the installation to finish.

3. **Configure environment variables:**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and set your API keys (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`).

4. **Run the development server:**

   ```sh
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

5. **Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.**

<br>

## Running on the Local DFX NETWORK

**To run the project in a local dfx network, you can use the command below**

- The project repository uses Dev Containers. Please install the Windows Subsystem for Linux beforehand as well as the ubuntu distro. Make sure that is running at a version later than 22.04

```sh
npm run deploy:local
```

<br>

## Modules

- **Farm Setup Basics:** Legal, environmental, and infrastructure requirements.
- **Pond & Water Care:** Water quality management, pond preparation, aeration, and effluent handling.
- **Healthy Stock Sourcing:** Accredited hatchery sourcing, quarantine, and stocking protocols.
- **Farm Access Control:** Visitor management, disinfection stations, and equipment hygiene.
- **Disease Readiness:** Health monitoring, emergency response, and veterinary compliance.

See [docs/modules.md](docs/modules.md) and [docs/ai-features.md](docs/ai-features.md) for full module and AI details.

<br>

## Data Model

The system uses a multi-entity data model for farm, assessment, planning, and reporting. See [docs/onboarding-erd.md](docs/onboarding-erd.md) for the ERD and entity descriptions.

<br>

## API Endpoints

- `/api/generate-assessment-plan` – Generates biosecurity tasks based on farm data.
- `/api/generate-plan` – Creates detailed action plans for risk factors.
- `/api/generate-how-to` – Produces step-by-step guides for farm tasks.
- `/api/chat-how-to` – AI chat support for how-to guides.
- `/api/submit` - Allows submission of onboarding form data to be sent towards the AI
