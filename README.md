# LikAI: Predictable Supply from Compliant Farms

![LikAI Cover Photo](./public/likai-cover.png)

We're using AI to help Filipino shrimp farmers build resilient farms and secure future harvests. Our mission is to strengthen the entire Philippine aquaculture industry, one healthy farm at a time.

## Overview

LikAI is a B2B platform that gives processors the tools to turn their small shrimp aquafarm suppliers into a compliant, resilient, and fully traceable network. We do this through three core components:

- **AI-Powered Farmer Coaching**: At the heart of our platform is an AI coach that delivers value directly to the shrimp aquafarmer. It provides personalized, daily action plans, 24/7 expert guidance, and smart investment advice to make achieving GAqP compliance simple and affordable.

- **Supply Chain Monitoring for Processors**: We provide processors with real-time visibility into the biosecurity and compliance scores of their entire shrimp supplier network. This allows them to proactively manage risk and identify high-performing partners.

- **Automated Reporting & On-Chain Certification**: The platform automatically generates the auditable compliance reports needed for export and BFAR accreditation. Upon completion, a verifiable **"Accreditation-Ready"** certificate can be issued as an on-chain NFT, guaranteeing a new level of trust and traceability.

## ICP Features used

- **Canisters**: Decentralized App & Data Hosting
- **Internet Identity**: Secure Farmer & Processor Login
- **HTTP Outcalls**: External AI & Real-World Data Integration
- **Timers**: Automated Farmer Reminders & Reports
- **Asset Canister**: Verifiable On-Chain Certifications

## How LikAI Works

### Step 1: Processor-Led Onboarding

- Processors invite their entire network of small farm suppliers, solving farmer acquisition and ensuring immediate scale.

### Step 2: Personalized Plan Generation

- Each invited farmer completes a simple assessment and instantly receives a personalized, AI-generated action plan for GAqP compliance.

### Step 3: Guided Daily Management

- Farmers follow their daily plans with 24/7 support from our AI Coach, ensuring consistent and correct implementation of biosecurity best practices.

### Step 4: Automated Compliance Reporting

- The platform tracks all farmer activity and generates automated compliance reports for processors, providing the auditable proof needed for export accreditation.

### Step 5: Verifiable On-Chain Certification

- Upon completion, a tamper-proof "Accreditation-Ready" certificate is issued as an on-chain NFT, guaranteeing trust and traceability in the supply chain.

## Project Progress
